## Exercise: Messaging System

#### Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to practice creating and managing multiple threads in a messaging system simulation.

#### Instructions:

1.	Create a Java class named MessagingSystem with a main method.
2.	Create a class named User that extends the Thread class. Each User should have the following responsibilities:
    -	Represent a user in the messaging system.
    -	Simulate sending and receiving messages.
    -	Print messages indicating when a user sends or receives a message.
    -	Sleep for random times between sending and receiving messages to simulate user interactions.
3.	In the main method of the MessagingSystem class, create at least three instances of the User class, representing different users in the messaging system.
4.	Start each User to simulate sending and receiving messages.
5.	Use proper thread naming to distinguish between the users (e.g., "User 1," "User 2," "User 3").
